## Penguins dataset 
### Import libraries
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyverse)
library(palmerpenguins)
library(ggthemes)
```

### Create plot

```{r}
penguins_plot = ggplot(
  data = penguins,
  mapping = aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g)
) +
  geom_point(aes(color = species, shape = species)) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  labs(
    title = "Body mass and flipper length",
    subtitle = "Dimensions for Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo Penguins",
    x = "Flipper length (mm)", y = "Body mass (g)",
    color = "Species", shape = "Species"
  ) +
  scale_color_colorblind()
penguins_plot
```

#### 2.2.5 Exercises 

**1. How many rows are in penguins? How many columns?**

```{r}
nrow(penguins) #rows
ncol(penguins) #columns
```

**2. What does the bill_depth_mm variable in the penguins data frame describe?**
```{r}
?penguins
```

Answer: bill_depth_mm
a number denoting bill depth (millimeters)

**3. Make a scatterplot of bill_depth_mm vs. bill_length_mm. That is, make a scatterplot with bill_depth_mm on the y-axis and bill_length_mm on the x-axis.**
```{r}
ggplot(
  data = penguins,
  mapping = aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm, color = species)
) +
  geom_point()
```

**4. What happens if you make a scatterplot of species vs. bill_depth_mm? What might be a better choice of geom?**

```{r}
ggplot(
  data = penguins,
  mapping = aes(x = species, y = bill_depth_mm, color = species)
) +
  geom_col()
```

**5. Why does the following give an error and how would you fix it?**

```{r}
#ggplot(data = penguins) + 
#  geom_point()
```
Answer: We need to add values for 'x' and 'y'

> Error in geom_point() :
ℹ Error occurred in the 1st layer.
Caused by error in `compute_geom_1()`:
! `geom_point()` requires the following missing aesthetics: x and y

**6. What does the na.rm argument do in geom_point()? What is the default value of the argument? Create a scatterplot where you successfully use this argument set to TRUE.**

Answer:
The na.rm argument in geom_point() is used to remove missing values (NA) from the data before plotting. When na.rm = TRUE, any rows containing missing values in    the x or y variables will be removed from the plot. If na.rm = FALSE (the default), any rows containing missing values will be plotted with missing values as       points.


```{r}
ggplot(
  data = penguins,
  mapping = aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = body_mass_g)
) +
  geom_point(na.rm = TRUE)
```


**7.Add the following caption to the plot you made in the previous exercise: “Data come from the palmerpenguins package.” Hint: Take a look at the documentation for labs().**

```{r}
ggplot(
  data = penguins,
  mapping = aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = body_mass_g)
) +
  geom_point(na.rm = TRUE) +
  labs(caption = "Data come from the palmerpenguins package.")
```

**8.Recreate the following visualization. What aesthetic should bill_depth_mm be mapped to? And should it be mapped at the global level or at the geom level?**

```{r}
ggplot(data = penguins, aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g, color = bill_depth_mm)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
  labs(title = "Body mass vs. flipper length colored by bill depth",
       x = "Flipper length (mm)",
       y = "Body mass (g)",
       color = "Bill depth (mm)")
```



**9. Run this code in your head and predict what the output will look like. Then, run the code in R and check your predictions.**

```{r}
ggplot(
  data = penguins,
  mapping = aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g, color = island)
) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE)
```

Answer: Without method = "lm" curves are not smooth. 
The se = FALSE argument in geom_smooth() is used to turn off the display of confidence intervals around the smoothing line.

**10. Will these two graphs look different? Why/why not?**

```{r}
ggplot(
  data = penguins,
  mapping = aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g)
) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth()

ggplot() +
  geom_point(
    data = penguins,
    mapping = aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g)
  ) +
  geom_smooth(
    data = penguins,
    mapping = aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g)
  )

```

Answer: These two graphs will produce the same plot.






















```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
